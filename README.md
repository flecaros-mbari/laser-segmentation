## Laser segmentation

Program to train and test a U-Net for my master degree.

### Codes in this repository
A copy of a colab that I had in my Drive. 

### TODO

* We can create a class to evaluate the testing images
* Search for other metrics to compare results
* Train with more data (different light)

### Libraries that you will need
* Numpy
* Open cv
* Glob
* Sys
* Sympy
* Matplotlib
* Pytorch
* Keras
* tqdm 
* pandas
* scipy

### Flow of the code (general)

1. Start the UNet class
2. Define the loss function and the weight of the classes 
3. Train with the images and their ground truth
4. Save the results
5. Evaluate the results and save them in excel
